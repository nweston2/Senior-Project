# JavaScript Variables

I have been teaching myself JavaScript. One of the first things I learned about was the different variable types and how to initialize them.

## Declaring Variables

Many things in JavaScript remind me a bit of Python. However, the more I learn about it, the more it reminds me of C#. For example, there is specific syntax associated with declaring variables.

There are three ways to declare variables:
* var
* let
* const

Unlike C#, you can technically forego the keyword when declaring a variable, but it is considered bad practice and can be confusing later on if a variable is not behaving the way you intended.

### var

For many years, this was the only variable type. However, as of 2015, this variable type is outdated. The let and const variables have replaced it. Variables should only ever be initialized with var if your website absolutely has to support old browsers (created prior to 2015). 

### let

### const
