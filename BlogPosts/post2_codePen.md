# Coding Tool: CodePen

This semester, I am taking WDD130 (Web Fundamentals). In this class, we are being taught how to code using html and css. Since I am teaching myself JavaScript for my Senior Project, this has come in handy since the three go hand in hand. 

In class a few weeks ago, I was introduced to a really cool website: [CodePen](https://codepen.io/). This site allows you to code in html, css, and javascript simultaneously and immediately see what your code does.
